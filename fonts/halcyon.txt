ABOUT HALCYON...Halcyon was created by moi, l'Abécédarienne, in 2004 with the helping hands and eyes of Mark Clarin. It contains a full set of accents and symbols (except scientific). It's my first all-digital font. The Moderne-inspired capitals were created first; I drew them in Illustrator. I added the lower case later in FontLab.Isn't it sweet?BY THE WAY...Halcyon means happy. it's also a drug in the same family as Xanax, Valium, Rohypnol and GHB. Enjoy!ABOUT DISTRIBUTION. . .You may distribute this font shamelessly. You may translate it to any platform, just don't change the name.
